## github commands
- git commit
- git pull
- git push
## general notes
not sure if its easier to use vsCode or the command line. vsCode handled the merge conflicts very different than the github page says. but if you edit the actual file then do a whole new commit a few times it works.

good note don't use the canvas to do this use the web page that is [this](https://learn.cs260.click/)
## Server Notes
- To ssh into the server use this 
- IP address = 18.214.45.63
- URL = http://18.214.45.63/ or [gardentimer.click](https://gardentimer.click/)
```
ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@53.104.2.123
```
## HTML Notes
I need a page for login a page to view the plants, and page to see information on the plants and I will do an about page. My HTML small assignment links here [media](https://codepen.io/kobydj/pen/QWoqvRL) [input](https://codepen.io/kobydj/full/LYazWzY) [structure](https://codepen.io/kobydj/pen/abMyRQw)

I have included an info page on my starter im not sure if i will have it be a page or if it will just pop up when you click on the plants. I also probably ought to make the password box write as circles instead of letters.
