# github commands
-git commit
-git pull
-git push
## general notes
not sure if its easier to use vsCode or the command line. vsCode handled the merge conflicts very different than the github page says. but if you edit the actual file then do a whole new commit a few times it works.

good note don't use the canvas to do this use the web page that is [this](https://learn.cs260.click/)
